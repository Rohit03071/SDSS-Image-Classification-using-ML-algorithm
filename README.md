You are seeing a project Idea which has come to my friend's and my mind recently. 
We have always been enthusiastic about everything astronomy, everything related to astonomical phenomena, space, dark matter everything. 
So we had this idea of making a software to classify all the galaxies we see in the known universe into classes which is being done by the scientists since ages, we just want to make the whole process automate. 
We want to make the classification process more time efficient, cost efficient and at the same time near perfect to human classification with bare eyes.
